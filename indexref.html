                Hello. I am an Aerospace Engineering/Computer Science student with a lot of technical hobbies. Currently enrolled at the University of Central Florida, I have had the oppurtunity to meet great people doing great things. These are the people who inspired me to do this: to make a concious effort into putting my creativity and skills to use. Although I may not have sufficient knowledge on some of these topics, my goal with this website is to keep myself accountable and be self-motivated to always achieve more. I have knowledge in primarily Java and C. I have also worked on multiple opensource projects in Swift. I am currently working on improving my skills in web development with a future goal of integrating machine learning.
